# r-data-analysis
* **Description**: Data analysis using R. I am especially interested in analyzing people's online behavior (Mobile apps, IMDB rating, and social media).
* **Date**: August - December 2018

## Project 1: App Store
Analysis of Apple App Store and Google Play Store applications, focusing on their genre, price, rating, app size, and number of installs. Uses summary statistics, proportional tables, t test, and ggplot visualizations (bar charts, histogram, scatterplot and regression line), and pipe/filter.
* **Code**: [abc-fb](https://github.com/jiinjeong/r-data-analysis/tree/main/abc-fb)
* **Datasets**: Kaggle
  * [Apple iOS App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home) contains data of almost 7,200 Apple iOS mobile applications, obtained from iTunes Search API in July 2017.
  * [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) collects data from 2010 until 2018 of around 10,000 Android mobile applications. <br>

## Project 2: IMDB Rating
Analysis of movie IMDB ratings to devise useful insights into how IMDB ratings are determined by different factors. Some characteristics we look at include social media likes (director likes, cast total likes, movie Facebook likes), promotion (number of faces on posters), finacial aspects (budget and gross earning), content and aesthetics (duration, content rating, BW or color, number of genres), year, language, and country. Uses various visualization and analytical tools, including regression, partial regression, scatterplot, etc.

## Project 3: ABC News on Facebook
Analysis of ABC News posts on Facebook to explore what makes a Facebook post successful and the relationships between Facebook interactions. We hope to gain useful insights into people's usage of social media. Some characteristics we look at include characteristics of each Facebook post (length, type, time postd), overall trend of likes, reactions, and successful posts (which we define as posts with over 10,000 likes). Uses various visualization and analytical tools including Chi-squared test, logistic regression, and time trend.
